# To use the new soft-caption pipeline, set this in your .env or docker-compose.yml:
#
# CAPTION_COMMAND=/app/py_captions_for_channels/embed_captions.sh {path}
#
# This ensures the pipeline uses the updated script for soft subtitle replacement.
#
# After updating, run:
#   docker compose down
#   docker compose build --no-cache
#   docker compose up -d
#
# Check logs for the executed command to confirm the script is used.
